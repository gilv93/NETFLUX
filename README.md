# NETFLUX

Welcome to Netflux, a React based Netflix clone.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to showcase and further my skills using React and more specifically, React hooks. 

I attempted to minimize the number of frameworks/libraries in this project in order to focus on using 
more vanilla JS/CSS where I could.

The Netflix Windows Desktop Application was the main inspiration for this clone project.
