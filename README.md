# NETFLUX

Welcome to Netflux, a React based netflix clone.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to showcase and further my skills using the React framework. 

I attempted to minimize the number of frameworks/libraries in this project in order to focus on using 
more vanilla JS/CSS while attempting to depend on the frameworks mostly for code structure.

The Netflix Windows Desktop Application was the main inspiration for this clone project.
